An interactive Go (Boardgame) tutorial for beginners. 

## Objectives
- Internationalization (explanation of the rules in allmost every language)
- easy and comfortable use for smartphone users (single-page application)
- good rule explanations and go problems that arouses attention, interest, desire, action (AIDA concept)
- do not overload the website with additional information, links, topics (Keep it smart and simple, KISS concept)
  - make it possible for other websites to embed the content easily (with iframe like googlemaps)
 
## Description of the use-case
The beginner can select a language. There are several levels and every level starts with a few lines of explanation and then comes the 9x9 Go board to solve a given task or to just look at a given example. When you solve a task on the go board, you can click everywhere you want and afterwards comes a feedback (the next move or the result correct/wrong). Then you can step backwards, repeat it or go to the next problem. 
There should be one section of levels for the basic rules and one bigger section of levels for intermediate learner. You can select the level you want to work on in the menu or you can just do each level one after another.
